## Description üì∞
```md
This application (Employee Manager) provides a command line interface for a user to maintain employee related data.  The user can make selections from two menus: Maintenance Menu and Reports Menu. The Maintenance Menu provides options that allow the user to maintain employee related data. The Reports menu provides options that allow the user to list employee relateed data in tabular format.

TECHNICAL DEATAILS
The user can Create/Read/Update/Delete data in all three employee related tables (Department, Employee, Role). All fields (columns) with the exception of the record id (column: id) can be modified in each table.  Data integrity is enforced, so a user cannot delete a department record if it is used on a role record.  A role record cannot be deleted if it is used on an employee record.

I altered the work flow because the example did not follow real world best practices and had an amateur appearance.
